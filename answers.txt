What is a remote repository?

A remote repository is a version of your project that is hosted on an online server such as GitHub.
It allows everyone on a team to share their local changes in a central repository.

What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

Git merge merges different git branches into a single branch while git rebase updates the start of your branch to a later commit that happened after you branched out.
